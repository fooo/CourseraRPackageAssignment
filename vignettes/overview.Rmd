The goal of CourseraRPackageAssignment is to explore the building of R packages and publishing them on GitHub including tests using Travis. This package is part of the Coursera 'Building R packages' course which is part of the 'Mastering Software Development in R' specialization.

The package contains functions to
* read FARS data and to retrieve the month and year of each accident from a given list of years
* retrieve the number of accidents per month for each wanted year
* plot a map of a given state with all accidents that happened in a given year

The package holds data for the year 2013,2014 and 2015. More data can be retrieved from the FARS site.

## Example

To plot the 2015 accidents in the state California (using the standard state codes):

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
currentpath = setwd('..')
library(CourseraRPackageAssignment)
fars_map_state(6, 2015)
setwd(currentpath)
```
